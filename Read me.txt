TO DO:

I'm going to write using OOP (object orientet programing)
using class, encapsulations, inheritance, friendship, data abstraction, polymorphism.


create levels

many different enemies

collision system

shoot options

damage system 

because my game is in the early development phase.

I hope, however, that you like my project.
